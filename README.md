## About ##
- 👀 I’m interested in ... creating beautiful frames on camera. Of course no :) For the most part, I am an Front-End Developer with 2+ years of experience. Skilled in Photoshop, Canva and JavaScript.
- Moreover, I like to spend time on programming, namely, not just on memorizing various programming languages, but on learning the correct application of algorithms, through the implementation of various projects. I've already developed private websites, my own Android apps, and I'm not going to stop there.
 ###### But still sometimes I like to make a couple of beautiful frames that you can find in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_b0gda_/). ######

## Languages ##
- 🌱  I’m currently learning React(JavaScript library), Node.js, Kotlin(in the future to get away from writing mobile applications in Java)
